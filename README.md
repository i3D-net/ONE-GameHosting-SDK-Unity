# i3D.net ONE Game Hosting SDK Unity Plug-in #

WIP

- Sample game (TODO: add link)

## SDK native libraries ##

The libraries are build using the [SDK source code](https://github.com/i3D-net/ONE-GameHosting-SDK).

_build_dlls.bat_ can be used to build all necessary native assemblies on Windows (can be located in the _Tools_ directory). [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) needs to be installed.
